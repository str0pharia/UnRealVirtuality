# UnRealVirtuality
Hot air balloon game. Inspired by that old-school helicopter flash game.

# Concept 
Pilot a hot air balloon that is automatically moving forward through an endless ravine, filled with obstacles. While also accelerating at an almost imperceptible rate. 
Avoid obstacles and survive for as long as possible. The game ends when the player collides with either an obstacle or the environment, at which point the player is awarded a score based on flight duration/distance covered. 

# Gameplay & Design
Designed for virtual reality headsets and motion controllers. 

# Controls
Pull handle to ignite gas and increase altitude, let go of the handle to decrease altitude. 
Use the weight of the player character to affect sideways movement, and - to some extent - the forward velocity,  by positioning yourself anywhere inside the  basket/play area, in order to redistribute the weight and tilt the basket in the corresponding direction. Lean angle of player / relative angle between controllers (along y-axis) to modify velocity and direction of the balloon even more. Note: To fly in a straight line you will have to maintain balance and remain centered in the play area/basket. 

Note that the yaw rotation of the basket is locked to prevent spin. This is an attempt to make the game more comfortable, especially for those who tend to experience motion sickness.
