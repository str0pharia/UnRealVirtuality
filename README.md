# UnRealVirtuality
Hot air balloon game. Inspired by that old-school helicopter flash game.

# Concept 
Pilot a hot air balloon that is automatically moving forward through an endless, procedurally generated environment, filled with obstacles. While also accelerating at an almost imperceptible rate. 

Avoid obstacles and survive for as long as possible. The game ends when the player collides with either an obstacle or the environment, at which point the player is awarded a score based on flight duration/distance covered. 

# Gameplay & Design
Designed for virtual reality headsets and motion controllers. 

. Items & Devices

Spawned as part of / on board the balloon. 
Items may be picked up by the player.
If anything is dropped (outside of basket/gondola), it is lost.
Devices may be interacted with by pushing buttons, turning knobs or pulling levers. 

.. Devices 

Burners
Ignites flammable gas to heat air inside the envelope. Pull and hold handle to activate. 

Meters
Various dials, meters and such, showing wind direction and speed etc. 

.. Items

Item: Propane Tanks 
Contains flammable gas used to power the balloon. A dial shows remaining gas in tanks. 
Place a propane tank in one of the assigned slots inside the gondola to refuel the burners.

Item: Longbow
Use the classic longbow to shoot at things and interact with physics-driven obstacles from a distance, to change the environment and clear a new path. 

# Controls
Pull burner handle to ignite gas and increase altitude, let go of the handle to decrease altitude. 

Use the weight of the player character to affect sideways movement, and - to some extent - the forward velocity,  by positioning yourself anywhere inside the  basket/play area, in order to redistribute the weight and tilt the basket in the corresponding direction. The idea is that the player will have to remain balanced in center to fly in a straight line.

Wind direction/speed affects how the balloon moves.
