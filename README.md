# Concept 
Pilot a hot air balloon that is automatically moving forward through an endless, procedurally generated environment, filled with obstacles. While also accelerating at an almost imperceptible rate. 

Avoid obstacles and survive for as long as possible. The game ends when the player collides with either an obstacle or the environment, at which point the player is awarded a score based on flight duration/distance covered. 

# Gameplay & Design
Designed for virtual reality headsets and motion controllers.

## Items & Devices
  - Spawned as part of / on board the balloon. 
  - Items may be picked up by the player.

  - Devices may be interacted with by pushing buttons, turning knobs or pulling levers. 

### Devices 

#### Burners
Ignites flammable gas to heat air inside the envelope. Pull and hold handle to activate. 

#### Meters
Various dials, meters and such, showing wind direction and speed etc. 

### Items

#### Propane Tanks 
Contains flammable gas used to power the balloon. A dial shows remaining gas in tanks.

#### Longbow
Use the classic longbow to shoot at things and interact with physics-driven obstacles from a distance, to change the environment and clear a new path. 

# Controls
