# Concept 
Pilot a hot air balloon that is automatically moving forward through an endless ravine, filled with obstacles. While also accelerating at an almost imperceptible rate. 
Avoid obstacles and survive for as long as possible. The game ends when the player collides with either an obstacle or the environment, at which point the player is awarded a score based on flight duration/distance covered. 

# Gameplay & Design
Designed for virtual reality headsets and motion controllers. 

# Controls
Pull handle to ignite gas and increase altitude, let go of the handle to decrease altitude. 
Grip sides of basket and lean witth the HMD left or right to tilt the basket, and move the balloon in the corresponding direction along the y-axis (strafe left/right). 
Note that it's not possible to control movemement along the x-axis (forward movement), nor is it possible to control yaw rotation.
